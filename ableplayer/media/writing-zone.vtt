00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.671
HOST: An average college
scene, the present.

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:09.609
Joy, your typical student, an
embodiment of hope, optimism,

3
00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:12.746
and dreams for the future,
embarks on a journey to better

4
00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.749
herself and her career.

5
00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.918
She navigates classes as
skillfully as a runner,

6
00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:23.089
channeling endurance and mental
strength, but in just a moment

7
00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.293
she will be stopped, frozen in
her tracks as she is grasped by

8
00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:32.165
fear because at three o' clock
on this day, Joy will sit down

9
00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:37.837
to start her first essay
with a looming deadline.

10
00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.642
Although time will continue on,
Joy will be stuck in the

11
00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.944
writing zone.

12
00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.286
FUTURE JOY: Hey girl.

13
00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.387
Still stuck on that paper, huh?

14
00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:56.389
PRESENT JOY: Excuse me?

15
00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:02.929
How did you know
I was writing a -?

16
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.130
FUTURE JOY: Oh, snap out of it.

17
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.732
We don't have time
for a meltdown.

18
00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:07.200
And before you ask, no.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.301
You're not dreaming.

20
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.504
Yes, I am really you from the
future and watch your drink.

21
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.645
PRESENT JOY: It's
finally happened.

22
00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.379
I've snapped.

23
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.648
FUTURE JOY: Well you're
certainly going to if you keep

24
00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:22.282
stressing over writing.

25
00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:23.283
PRESENT JOY: But I.

26
00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.219
FUTURE JOY: We always stress
over writing and this paper is

27
00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.020
due next week.

28
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.588
PRESENT JOY: I'm going
to fail this class.

29
00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:29.956
FUTURE JOY: No.

30
00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:32.559
We used to stress over writing.

31
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:36.196
Oh how times have changed.

32
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.564
Relax.

33
00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.299
I'm here to walk you through it.

34
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.837
I've been in your
shoes - literally.

35
00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:45.271
This really isn't
that big of a deal.

36
00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:48.942
PRESENT JOY: I don't
even know where to start.

37
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.244
This subject is too
difficult to put into words.

38
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:52.946
FUTURE JOY: Yeah.

39
00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.014
It is certainly a topic you
don't know much about yet but

40
00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.484
that has never
stopped you before.

41
00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.119
It's not as difficult
or scary as you think.

42
00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.989
It only seems scary at first
like many of the things

43
00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:03.723
we've done.

44
00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.124
PRESENT JOY: What do you mean?

45
00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.094
FUTURE JOY: Do you remember
repelling off of that cliff to

46
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:08.895
impress Mark?

47
00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.064
PRESENT JOY: That
was terrifying.

48
00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:12.999
FUTURE JOY: I'd say.

49
00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.767
But we did it anyway.

50
00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:19.239
And writing is not nearly as
risky as dangling over a cliff.

51
00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.541
You just need to put
it into perspective.

52
00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.244
Think about the first time we
tried to learn how to

53
00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.880
ride a bike.

54
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.682
We were terrified of that bike
too because we had to learn the

55
00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:32.185
basics before we were
comfortable enough to try it on

56
00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.820
our own.

57
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.023
For us, writing is like
learning to ride a bike.

58
00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:43.062
PRESENT JOY: So how did you -
how do we - I mean, how do I get

59
00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:43.897
started then?

60
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.599
FUTURE JOY: You may not have
training wheels for this but

61
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.801
there are resources
to get you started.

62
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.404
The university has an essay
writing workshop that you can

63
00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.507
take for free along with some
other writing resources.

64
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.076
PRESENT JOY: Do you really
think that will help me?

65
00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.412
FUTURE JOY: I know it will.

66
00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.814
It will teach you the writing
process and then the more papers

67
00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:04.484
you write, the easier
it will become.

68
00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:07.987
Like any challenge, you have to
learn the process first and then

69
00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.522
practice, practice, practice.

70
00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.893
PRESENT JOY: I guess it never
hurts to give it a try.

71
00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:16.663
Thanks, Joy.

72
00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.465
FUTURE JOY: That a girl.

73
00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.668
Now take a deep breath
and get clicking.

74
00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.703
You've got this.

75
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.004
See you next time.

76
00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.178
HOST: In any new struggle, we
find that uncertainties can

77
00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.213
hinder our success.

78
00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:37.250
Case and point, Joy has
now discovered something

79
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.220
advantageous to her college
career and her life.

80
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.390
When we stop to consider what
skills we already have and

81
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:47.794
everything we've achieved, we
are helping ourselves remember

82
00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:48.861
to keep pushing forward.

83
00:03:49.963 --> 00:03:55.635
File this lesson under C for
confidence in the writing zone.
