## Able Player for WordPress

[Able Player](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer) is a fully accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player. This plugin gives you the ability to include media in any post or page with an easy to use shortcode. Your media will be wrapped in the Able Player interface thus making them more accessible to users of screen readers and keyboards (or other non-mouse input devices).

**Example Video:**
```
[able_player src="http://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/BigBuckBunny_320x180.mp4"]
```

**Example Audio:**
```
[able_player src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Test_mp3_opus_16kbps.wav"]
[able_player src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/The_Waste_Land.ogg" ogg_type="audio"]
```

The following file types are currently supported by Able Player:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Video*: webm, webmv, mp4, ogg*, ogv
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Audio*: mp3, ogg*, oga, wav
\* requires the inclusion of an additional parameter/attribute in the shortcode: `ogg_type = [audio|video]`.
